#### Supported Keywords

Note that except for values before a colon in keywords using them (which must match the regex `[A-z]*`), anything may be quoted to preserve whitespace or otherwise special characters.

| keyword | effect |
| --- | --- |
| (default) | non-special words check for a string match on every field of the object. |
| `:has:[something]` | true if the object has a field named `something` |
| `:is:[something]` | same as `:has:` |
| `[key]:[value]` | true if `value` equals the `key` property |
| `AND` | does nothing (it's the default) |
| `OR` | logical OR of the conditions on either side |
| `NOT` | negates the next keyword |
| `-[something]` | negates the next keyword; unlike `not` doesn't need a space |
| `(` and `)` | allows grouping of terms |
| `#[xxx]` | true if the `.tags` property contains `xxx` |
| `:before:[xxx]` | true if the `.date` property is less than `xxx` |
| `:after:[xxx]` | true if the `.date` property is greater than `xxx` |
